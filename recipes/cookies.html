    <h1>Best Choc-chip Cookies</h1>
    <img src="./cookies.jpg" alt="choc-chip cookies on plate" height="250" width="250">

    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Texture: The texture should be crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. This can be achieved by using a mix of brown and white sugars and not overbaking the cookies.</p>
    <p>Flavor: The cookie should have a rich, buttery flavor with a hint of vanilla. The chocolate chips should be semi-sweet and not too overwhelming in flavor.</p>
    <p>Appearance: The cookie should be golden brown on the outside and slightly lighter in the center, with visible chocolate chips scattered throughout.</p>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine melted butter and sugars in a large bowl. Stir very well.</li>
        
        <li>Add egg and egg yolk, stir well.</li>
       
        <li>Stir in vanilla extract. Set aside.</li>
       
        <li>In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        
        <li>Gradually add flour mixture to wet ingredients -- stir well so that all the flour is absorbed.</li>
        
        <li>Stir in chocolate chips.</li>
        
        <li>Place dough in refrigerator and chill for 30 minutes.</li>
       
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C) and prepare cookie sheets by lining with parchment paper.
            Scoop dough by rounded 1 ½ tablespoon onto prepared cookie sheets, placing at least 2" apart.
            Bake for 11 minutes -- cookies may still seem slightly soft in the centers, that is OK, they will cook completely on the cookie sheets. Don't over-bake or your cookies will be too hard.
            If desired, gently press additional chocolate chips into the tops of the warm cookies.
            Allow to cool completely on cookie sheets.
